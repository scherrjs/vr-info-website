			<p>As Virtual Reality technology advances, a variety of problems begin to crop up
			that can cause problems in accesibility for many potential users. For instance, the hardware
			in its current state is quite bulky. It can be uncomfortable to wear and maneuver in, and 
			can get sweaty and hot quickly. This can reduce its appeal to users, making it harder to expand
			the technological field. Additionally, "VR Sickness" poses a large problem for many users. A
			large amount of applications move the user in VR space while their physical body stays still.
			This can cause significant discomfort and motion sickness. Additionally, current VR smash hits
			are few and far between. Many industries have been slow to apply the technology, and many
			VR applications are just adaptations of non-VR technology that does not take full advantage 
			of the technology. Finally, many mixed and virtual reality software boasts its ability to be 
			used anywhere, but many of these applications remain limited by the need for a steady internet 
			connection, drastically reducing its potential.</p>
